# Syllabally

Syllabally is a tool designed to help students pick the right courses and sections throughout their university journey. Using Syllabally, students can take a look at the syllabi for past and current courses, across every section, and use that information to make more informed choices about the courses and sections they are taking. They can read notes prepared by previous students, compare reviews and ratings of each course and the relevant professors, and determine where each course will fit in their overall undergrad process. We believe that students should have more choices, more information, and the ability to have a more holistic understanding of the entire undegraduate degree process at York, and Syllabally will go a long way towards supporting that.

## Usage
Syllabally is a web application, hosted on Google Cloud Platforms. Once live, you can access and use the application at www.syllabally.com (placeholder).

## Installing and Contributing

To run Syllabally locally, you'll need:

- A package manager suitable for a JavaScript/Next.js app. We recommend [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), but [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) or [pnmp](https://pnpm.io) will work too.
- A Python 3 runtime. The project was built on **3.13**, but any runtime newer than 3.10 should work without issue.
- Next.js v14 or newer.

Once your dependencies are in check, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to access the application.

Please submit any changes or feature changes as pull requests to a new branch on this repository. A maintainer will review and merge the pull requests accordingly.
