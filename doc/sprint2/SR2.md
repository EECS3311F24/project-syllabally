## Unfinished Tasks:
- <ins> Credit Functionality: </ins> The backend for this system involves Firebase Functions, of which we are presently unfamiliar with. About 70% of the necessary functionality has been established for this feature to be up and running and the user story fulfilled. However, since the remaining 30% is fragile and could mess up the 70% already established, this has not yet been completed. The completion of this task is projected to be done by November 20th, therefore it is pushed down to the final Sprint. <br>
- <ins> Uploading Syllabus Feature: </ins> This feature was placed into our active sprint board for the Sprint in the first Standup meeting, but quickly we realized it would require learning an entirely new system and would therefore be too cumbersome to accomplish along with the credit modification feature. As such, by the second Standup meeting, it was decided that this user story would be pushed down to the final Sprint. <br>

## Next Sprint - Continued Practices:
- <ins> Consistent communication within group members: </ins> Much like the continued practice mentioned in the previous sprint, this practice helps understand everyone’s current progress, as well as the desired tasks to work on. As well, it helps determine if changes need to be made to plan very quickly, and if members require help from others in terms of workload. <br>
- <ins> Developing React skills further: </ins> This is imperative for the final sprint as the final product needs to be as polished as possible. As such, from the perspective of the front end, learning skills that will help elevate the look and branding of the product will immensely help. <br>

## Next Sprint - New Practices:
- <ins> Distribute workload more evenly amongst members: </ins> This was mentioned as a new practice for the previous sprint. However, due to several circumstances including the usual varying workloads or skill sets between members, there is still room for improvement in this department. This practice will help in the same ways as previously mentioned, with the balancing of the work needed to be completed as well as gaining insight into the different programs implemented so that every member understands the inner workings of the whole product. <br>

## Harmful Practices:
- <ins> Isolating between back-end and front-end development: </ins> This remains a theoretically harmful practice as it was in the previous Sprint. Once more, the way to alleviate the damage that this can create (members being unsure of how certain aspects of either side of the development function) is by attempting to go through further meetings earlier on to establish a clear plan and understanding of the development to come <br>

## Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 2:
- <ins> Best </ins> 
  - Functionality established for a key feature in the application - the credit system <br>
  - Continued fleshing out of the UI for the website ensures that the final Sprint will bring a polished look of Syllabally for users to interact with <br>
  - Maya: I have established a way to locally clone the repo so that I can contribute to the Sprint’s development outside of the standard documentation and organisation <br>
- <ins> Worst </ins>
  - Once again, the sprint felt rushed due to extenuating circumstances (assignments and tests) <br>
  - Sickness resulted in difficulty meeting up or developing a back-end feature, which was out of any member’s control but still added strain to the time <br>
