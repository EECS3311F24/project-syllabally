**Project Title:** Syllabally <br> 

**Participants:** Hien Le, Maya Shamir, Thomas Aziz <br>

**Notetaker:** Maya Shamir <br>

**Unfinished Tasks:**
- <ins>Credit Balance:</ins> The User Story “As a student, I want to view my contribution credit balance, so I can keep track of how much I can unlock.” was not completed due to a lack of time. This story was valued at 5 points, and was the least prioritized task to accomplish within Sprint 1. The tasks of establishing basic registration/login with an authorization, as well as a search functionality was valued above this task. As such, the User Story itself remains the same, but is pushed into a future Sprint to be completed.
- <ins>Filter searches:</ins> While we managed to implement a search functionality for YorkU courses, we have not yet established the filter option described in the User Story “As a student, I want to search and filter through syllabi so that I can find relevant resources efficiently.” So, while the main aspect of the story has been accomplished, the new User Story can state “As a student, I want to filter through my searches so that I can find the most relevant results.”
- <ins>Front-End pages:</ins> The home page is left as a skeleton at the moment, not including other components specific to the original UI Figma prototype. The front-end relies on the back-end implementation, so as such the existing page caters mainly to the search functionality. Future tasks will focus on the implementation of more components for the main home page, additional screens, and personalizing the existing screens to fit within a cohesive design that represents Syllabally. This task is not a singular User Story, as it goes hand in hand with the functionalities demanded by the already existing User Stories. It is however important to the design of the final product, and so is maintained as an unfinished task to consider and work on in future Sprints. <br>

**Next Sprint - Continued Practices:**
- <ins>Consistent communication within group members:</ins> Aids in understanding the current progress and future prioritizations, as well as figuring out in what ways the back-end and front-end should correspond to one another as development progresses
- <ins>Developing JavaScript skills:</ins> For some members, this project is their introduction into the sphere of JavaScript and REACT. Furthering individual understanding and expanding the toolkit helps in the development of the project, greatly assisting in the implementation of complex features down the road <br>

**Next Sprint - New Practices:**
- <ins>Distribute workload more evenly amongst members:</ins> allows each member to contribute more to the project, understand further the components being worked on, and aid in the workload of others. Helps to alleviate the recurring blocker brought up in the stand up meetings, where balancing other assignments and tests takes away from progress in the project. 
- <ins>Utilize Storybook:</ins> This will help with the front-end documentation and testing. It seems like a powerful tool that we would like to learn more about <br>

**Harmful Practices:**
- <ins>Isolating between back-end and front-end development:</ins> keeping the development of back-end and front-end exclusive to certain members can be helpful in the implementation of both aspects, but also creates a few blindsides in understanding the inner workings and functionalities of certain features. In order to integrate this development, further meetings explaining the functionality and back-end approach would be helpful in eliminating confusion. Members also taking a more full-stack approach helps in consistent development rather than waiting on one side to be finished in order to implement the other. 
- <ins>Not having a very detailed breakdown of task assignments:</ins> each member should correspond to better laid out task breakdowns, which also helps in GitHub tracking for commits. During this Sprint, this was not accomplished due to the group’s understanding that a member works either within back-end OR front-end, thereby making task assignments self-explanatory. Also, issues with pulling/cloning GitHub repos (Maya) meant tasks were not assigned in the way they were originally supposed to be, where Maya would also push front-end code. One workaround for this was to assign Maya more administrative tasks such as notetaking and pushing/updating deliverable documents to the repository. <br>

**Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 1:**
- <ins>Best:</ins>
  - Efficient completion of several expected features
  - Learning new functionalities, expanding development toolkit via JavaScript and REACT
  - Conducting meaningful meetings that provided checkpoints and brought all members together on the same page
- <ins>Worst:</ins>
  - Rushed experience, mainly due to many other assignments and tests due during the 1st week of Sprint 1
  - Unable to connect to one of the members, resulting in their removal and a resulting three-member sprint 1, which further stressed individual workload and tight deadlines
  - Maya: Specifically, I could not clone the repo and host the application locally in order to contribute to front-end development with Hien. Attempted to compensate by       creating documents, conducting meetings, and notetaking. I have to troubleshoot the issue for upcoming sprints to contribute more equally to the actual code development     as opposed to focusing mainly on the other deliverables.
