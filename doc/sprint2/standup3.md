## 1. What did you work on since the last standup? 
- Establishing initial functionality of credit system using Firebase <br>
- To modify credits (functionality to update or deduct or add) is done through the use of Firebase functions <br>
- Constructing the basic structure of the display page for each course. <br>


## 2. What do you commit to next?
- We will be finishing up the documentation needed for Sprint 2 <br>
- Will be updating our Trello and product backlog to realistically reflect the user story focus for the next and final Sprint <br>
- We will be working out the code implemented for this current Sprint to have finished, finalized functionality for Sprint 3 <br>


## 3. When do you think you’ll be done?
- By midnight tonight, all deliverables will be placed in the doc folder of the Sprint 2 branch <br>
- User stories that were uncompleted will be provided new date goals for completion in Sprint 3 <br>
- The credit modification feature should be done by November 20th (Sprint 3)


## 4. Do you have any blockers? 
- Assignments and tests outside of the project take away from the time spent working on it <br>
- Personal issues have created problems with scheduling meetings, but this is understood to be temporary and outside of anyone’s control <br>
- There is an issue to troubleshooting with the back-end system involving learning a new tool and ensuring it does not crash when used <br>
