**Sprint 2 Planning Meeting (sprint2.md)** <br>
**Project Title: Syllabally** <br>

## 1.  Sprint Goal
- The goal of sprint 2 is to continue establishing core functionalities of the platform, the credits system and the skeleton of the course page for further features such as uploads, forum, rating, etc. By the end of the sprint, the platform should allow users to view their credits, the basic visual on the course page where they can do the uploads, forums, ratings and course information, continuing building the foundation for the platform. <br>

## 2. Participants
- Product Owner: Maya Shamir <br>
- Developers: Thomas Aziz <br>
- UI/UX Designers: Hien Le <br>

## 3. User Stories Sprint 2

**User Story 1: Contribution Credit System - Viewing Credit Balance (7 Points)** <br>
As a student, I want to view my contribution credit balance, so I can keep track of how much I can unlock <br>
**User Story 2: Categorise the uploads (20 Points)** <br>
As a student, I want to categorise the uploads (practice materials, support sites, syllabus, etc.), so others can easily find what they are looking for. <br>
**User Story 3: Contribution Credit System - Earning Credits  (5 Points)** <br>
As a student, I want to earn contribution credits for each upload, so I feel motivated to share helpful syllabi. <br>

## 4. Task Breakdown

- Design credit display on user dashboard (Designer) <br>
- Set up backend for credit calculation and storage (Backend Developer) <br>
- Implement credit balance display on front-end (Frontend Developer) <br>

**User Story 2: Categorise the uploads** <br>
- Design a general course page UI (Designer) <br>
- Set up a backend for storing files, syllabuses. (Backend Developer) <br>
- Implement course display on front-end (Frontend Developer) <br>

**User Story 3: Contribution Credit System - Earning Credits**<br>

- Set up backend credit calculation for each user participation (Backend Developer) <br>
- Implement other UI functionality such as the course information, rating displays, and the forum, which also ways for users earning their credit (Frontend Developer) <br>
## 6. Decisions and Notes

**Priority User Stories:** Viewing userâ€™s credits, as well as course upload page, are the highest priority to allow user engagement with the platform following the authentication and search phases. <br>
**Dependencies:** The syllabus upload functionality must be completed so that the credit calculation can be active (upload the syllabus is one of a way to earn credit). <br>
**Technical Considerations:** Decided to use Firebase for the credit system to streamline development. For storing the syllabus, using the Google Storage as a database. <br>
**Risk:** Limited time may impact the depth of testing; focus on ensuring core functionality works before adding enhancements. Uploads could be removed from current Sprint due to the need to establish a whole separate infrastructure, likely using Google Cloud storage. <br>

## 7. Action Items
- **Design Team:** Complete UI designs for credit system, and the course page for this sprint. <br>
- **Development Team:** Begin backend work for user credit tracking, then move to front-end integration. If possible, begin constructing the database infrastructure for storing uploaded syllabuses. <br>

## 8. Conclusion
- Sprint 2 will deliver core platform functionalities, allowing users to be familiar with 
earn/view credits, and upload syllabi. This establishes a foundation for future engagement and feature expansion in upcoming sprints. <br>
