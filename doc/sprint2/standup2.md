Members: Hien, Maya, Thomas <br>

## 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
UI of credit page 

## 2. What do you commit to next?
- Implementing credits system <br>
- Readjusting front-end for credits page, home page, other various pages <br>
- Readjusting from previous Sprint, no longer focusing on document upload <br>
- Still focusing on user stories Three and Ten <br>
- The back-end of the credit system will be completed by Thomas <br>
- The front-end of the pages will be completed by Hien and Maya <br>

## 3. When do you think youâ€™ll be done?
- Back-end should be completed by Saturday, November 16th <br>
- Front-end will be worked through until Sunday, November 17th, as it also relies on the implemented back-end <br>

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
- Conflicting deadlines from other assignments <br>
- Sickness curtailed the ability to work or meet at the standard rate <br> 
- Uploads were removed from current Sprint due to the need to establish a whole separate infrastructure, likely using Google Cloud storage which cannot be set up and configured within the time frame of the next few days
