Syllabally: Project Summary
===========================

Project Overview
----------------

Syllabally is a web application designed to provide university students with a way to access and evaluate syllabi for various courses without the need to enroll or switch sections. The platform allows students to upload syllabi from their enrolled courses, and in exchange, they earn a "credit" for each syllabus uploaded. These credits can be used to unlock syllabi for other courses, helping students make more informed enrollment decisions based on the course content, workload, and structure. Syllabally also allows students to converse amongst one another, providing helpful advice and input in planning out a student's university experience. 

Project Objectives
------------------

The main objectives of Syllabally are:

-   To enable students to share and access syllabi for university courses in an easy and efficient manner.

-   To provide students with a tool for evaluating multiple courses, aiding them in making better decisions about their course enrollments.

-   To foster a collaborative and resource-sharing environment among students, promoting informed academic choices.

-   To provide students with related courses to their selected syllabus, including future courses they could do as a result of completing said course. 

Key Users
---------

The key users of Syllabally are:

1.  University students who wish to share and access syllabi for different courses.

2.  Academic advisors who may refer students to the platform for better course planning.

3.  Instructors and course coordinators who may review the syllabi uploaded by students to ensure accuracy.

Key Use Cases
-------------

1.  Syllabus Upload and Credit System:

-   A student uploads the syllabus for a course they are currently enrolled in. Upon successful upload, their account is credited with one "credit."

-   The student can use this credit to unlock the syllabus for another course of their choice.

-   Credits can also be earned by performing other helping activities on the platform (possible example: reviewing a course for other students to see), thereby encouraging students to be actively involved

-   When signing up on Syllabally, students will automatically be given a certain amount of credits to use as they wish

3.  Syllabus Evaluation for Enrollment:

-   A student who is undecided about enrolling in a course can use their credits to unlock and view syllabi for different sections or courses, helping them compare content, assignments, and course structures before making a decision.

-   The student can also project the degree plan on the platform for better preparation in their future enrollments.

5.  Syllabus Repository and Sharing:

-   Syllabally serves as a central repository for syllabi. Students can access a wide variety of syllabi across different faculties, programs, and course levels, providing a better understanding of courses without needing to attend or enrol in them.

Key Usage Scenarios
-------------------

1.  Pre-Enrollment Decision Making:

-   A student, uncertain about enrolling in a particular course, uses their credits to unlock syllabi from multiple sections of the course. They compare the readings, assignments, grading rubrics, and learning outcomes across sections to make a more informed decision on enrollment.

3.  Course Planning for Future Terms:

-   A student who is planning their academic path for the next semester uploads syllabi from their current courses, earns credits, and unlocks syllabi for advanced courses they are considering for future terms. This helps them prepare for the upcoming course load and requirements.

5.  Syllabus Verification by Instructors:

-   Instructors or course coordinators may use Syllabally to verify the syllabi that students have uploaded, ensuring the material is accurate and reflects the current course content.

Prioritisation Considerations
-----------------------------

-   Credit System and Upload Mechanism: High priority to ensure the core feature of earning and using credits works smoothly.

-   User Authentication and Permissions: Prioritise securing the platform and preventing unauthorised access or manipulation of syllabi.

-   Search and Filtering Options: Implement features to allow students to easily search and filter syllabi based on course code, instructor, or department.

-   Accuracy of Syllabus Content: Consider adding moderation or verification features to ensure syllabi uploaded by students are up-to-date and correct.

Conclusion
----------

Syllabally aims to simplify the course selection process for university students by giving them access to syllabi for multiple courses. By fostering a sharing ecosystem, Syllabally empowers students to make better academic decisions, ultimately improving the course enrollment experience.
