# How is our product different?

Our product is distinct from the above competitors. Particularly, the main objective of this product is to support the user in selecting the course for their next semester. This is a tool where the user can explore their capabilities to join courses and get connected with the community. Furthermore, for each course in the degree progress, the student can access past syllabuses that are uploaded by students who have completed the course before. To make the product more active, we introduce the credit system that allows users to spend it to unlock the uploaded materials and earn by making contributions. Overall, our product is a combination of all our competitors.

# Why is our product better for specific uses and scenarios?

The other competitors just focus on a singular task. For Rate My Professor, that task is rating professors for specific courses. For the r/Yorku subreddit, it is a forum to find classmates and discuss. For CourseDelta, it is visually planning courses within York University departments. Meanwhile, our product combines all those features at once so that the user has all the tools they need in one place and do not need to jump between sites. An incoming post-secondary student may find everything vague and feel they need a great deal of support. Our product provides an accessible all-in-one platform that can let you stay updated with your degree progress, has an overview about your future instructors, and also find a community for you to stay connected. The competitors did not focus on these features since their main objective is to serve a particular demand, whereas we focus on every perspective that the student may need for their student career.
