# Reflection

When beginning the work on the project, our group observes many positive contributions toward the project despite the fact that there are some points that need improvement for further phases.

While making decisions and ideas, our group's priority is to respect all contributions, constantly asking questions and having discussions that resolve any confusion among members. The final decision is confirmed only when all members of the group are satisfied and make an agreement towards the end. A similar process is used when generating and prioritising the user stories. Everyone can provide as many features as they want to be in this product, then discussions are held and we select which user stories work best and are most manageable for us to accomplish.

For communication, our group mostly uses our Discord server to discuss the topic and specific project ideas. This platform is the most familiar amongst the members and is rather convenient. Members of this group usually meet each other when they share their common time on campus, mostly after the lecture sections, or during the lab. Hence, this makes the meeting process more efficient and easy because all members can stay connected and reduce the time spent travelling.

However, there are some parts that need improvement that we have learned from Sprint 0. In some meetings, not all members of the group can attend, which can break the progress consistency among members. Therefore, we can minimise this issue by scheduling weekly online meetings so that everyone can find a time to attend the meeting and ensure the work can be completed within set deadlines. For the next phase, our group will continue to collaborate positively and try to perfect parts that need improvement.
