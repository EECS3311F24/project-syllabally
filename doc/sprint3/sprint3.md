**Sprint 3 Planning Meeting (sprint3.md)** <br>
**Project Title: Syllabally** <br>

## 1.  Sprint Goal
- The goal of sprint 3 is to continue establishing core functionalities of the platform, back-end data of the credit system and redesign the course page UI with its corresponding back-end database. By the end of the sprint, the platform should have an active credit database, the updated visual on the course page where users can do the uploads, forums, ratings and course information, finalizing the core features of the platform. <br>

## 2. Participants
- Product Owner: Maya Shamir <br>
- Developers: Thomas Aziz <br>
- UI/UX Designers: Hien Le <br>

## 3. User Stories Sprint 3

**User Story 1: Contribution Credit System - Earning Credit Balance (5 Points)** <br>
As a student, I want to view my contribution credit balance, so I can keep track of how much I can unlock <br>
**User Story 2: Visual for Syllabus Container (10 Points)** <br>
As a student, I want to view and download the uploaded material, so I can have a better overview of the course that I am considering. <br>
**User Story 3: Visual for Discussion Forums (10 Points)** <br>
As a user, I want to be able to engage in discussion forums, so that I can get specialized feedback for questions. <br>

## 4. Task Breakdown

**User Story 1: Contribution Credit System - Viewing Credit Balance** <br>
- Set up backend for credit calculation and storage (Backend Developer) <br>
- Implement credit balance display on front-end (Frontend Developer) <br>

**User Story 2: Visual for Syllabus Container ** <br>
-  Focus mostly on building the information box in the course page UI where students can view the uploaded syllabus for the selected course and have the option to upload the files via a button (Designer) <br>
- Set up a backend for storing files, syllabi, if possible. (Backend Developer) <br>
- Implement syllabi display on front-end (Frontend Developer) <br>

**User Story 3: Visual for Discussion Forums **<br>
- Design the forum chat box in the course page. The main objective feature for this story is to have the front-end design for users to engage in the discussion forums and a foundation for the back-end to implement the operation. (Designer) <br>
- Implement other UI functionality for the forum, if possible (Frontend Developer) <br>

## 6. Decisions and Notes
**Priority User Stories:** Viewing userâ€™s credits, as well as the two visuals for the uploaded and forum boxes, are the highest priority to allow user engagement with the platform following the UI for the credit and course page from last sprint 2. <br>
**Dependencies:** Given that the UI for the credit page has been completed from last sprint, hence, the dependency for the credit system from the back-end has no risk. Furthermore, redesigning the syllabus and forums boxes in the course page UI solves the dependencies for further implementation for back-end. <br>
**Technical Considerations:** Decided to use Firebase for the credit system to streamline development. For storing the syllabus, using Google Storage as a database. <br>
**Risk:** Limited time may impact the depth of testing; focus on ensuring core functionality works before adding enhancements.<br>

## 7. Action Items
**Design Team:** Redesign the UI for the uploaded syllabus box and the discussion forum box in course page UI. <br>
**Development Team:** Begin backend work for user credit tracking, then move to front-end integration. Then, begin consolidating the user account so that the credit system can be assigned for each user. If possible, the developer could start building the database for syllabus uploading.<br>

## 8. Conclusion
- Sprint 3 will continue to deliver core platform functionalities, allowing users to be familiar with earn/view credits, upload syllabi, and discussion forum. This establishes a foundation for future engagement and feature expansion in upcoming sprints. <br>
