[December 01, 2024] - Sprint 3 Standup 3 <br>
Members: Hien, Maya, Thomas <br>


## 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
- Updating the new visual for the uploaded syllabus box in course page UI<br>
- Updating the new visual for the discussion forum box in course page UI<br>


## 2. What do you commit to next?
- This is the last stand up and also the last sprint for the project. If possible, we would like to build the database for users to upload the syllabus for each selected course.<br>

## 3. When do you think youâ€™ll be done?
- As mentioned, this is the last stand up and also the last sprint for the project.<br>

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
- As usual, additional assessments have taken up time <br>
- The loss of members that we had from previous sprints carried over into this one, as we operated as the minimum number of people in a group rather than the maximum, causing the workload to be a lot heavier for the remaining members <br>
- Currently, figuring out the upload system via Google Cloud is presenting challenges, so troubleshooting and learning is required <br>
