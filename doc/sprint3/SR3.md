##Unfinished Tasks:
<ins> Syllabus Upload: <ins> This was a plan we had established for the sprint in hopes we could have the feature up and ready. Unfortunately, our back-end development faced issues and errors working within a system that was new to us all, so the completion of the task was not feasible. 

## Harmful Practices:
- <ins> Isolating between back-end and front-end development: </ins> This remains a theoretically harmful practice as it was in the previous Sprint. Once more, the way to alleviate the damage that this can create (members being unsure of how certain aspects of either side of the development function) is by attempting to go through further meetings earlier on to establish a clear plan and understanding of the development to come

## Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 3:
<ins> Best </ins> 
Figured out a way to run the registration and login functionalities consistently and without error
Continued fleshing out of the UI for the website
Worked out a functional credit system and the corresponding UI
<ins> Worst </ins>
Once again, the sprint felt rushed due to extenuating circumstances (assignments and tests)
Difficulty meeting up or developing a back-end feature due to time constraints
