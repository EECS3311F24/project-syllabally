**Sprint 1 Planning Meeting (sprint1.md)** 

**Project Title:** Syllabally

**Participants:** Hien Le, Maya Shamir, Thomas Aziz

**1.  Sprint Goal** <br>
The goal of sprint 1 is to establish the core functionalities of the platform, enabling students to create accounts, search for courses, and the credits system. By the end of the sprint, the platform should allow users to register, authenticate, and interact with basic content features, building the foundation for the platform.

Product Owner: Maya Shamir <br>
Developers: Thomas Aziz <br>
UI/UX Designers: Hien Le 

**3. Sprint 1 User Stories** <br>
<ins>User Story 1: User Registration and Authentication</ins> <br>
*As a student, I want to create an account so that I can access the platform and share syllabi.* <br>
<ins>User Story 2: Contribution Credit System</ins> <br>
*As a student, I want to view my contribution credit balance, so I can keep track of how much I can unlock.* <br>
<ins>User Story 3: Basic Search Functionality</ins> <br>
*As a student, I want to search through syllabi so that I can find relevant resources efficiently.* B

**4. Task Breakdown** <br>
<ins>User Story 1: User Registration and Authentication</ins> <br>
Design Registration and Login UI  (Designer) <br>
Set up backend authentication (API for user registration and login) (Backend Developer) <br>
Implement front-end form validation and error handling  (Frontend Developer) <br>
Integrate front-end and backend for registration and login (Frontend Developer) <br>

<ins>User Story 2: Contribution Credit System</ins> <br>
Design credit display on user dashboard (Designer) <br>
Set up backend for credit calculation and storage (Backend Developer) <br>
Implement credit balance display on front-end (Frontend Developer) <br>

<ins>User Story 3: Basic Search Functionality</ins> <br>
Design search bar UI (Designer) <br>
Set up backend search functionality and filtering (Backend Developer) <br>
Implement front-end search bar and integrate with backend (Frontend Developer) <br>

**5. Decisions and Notes** <br>
<ins>Priority User Stories:</ins> User registration and authentication, as well as search for courses, are the highest priority to allow user engagement with the platform from the beginning. <br>
<ins>Dependencies:</ins> User registration must be completed before any features requiring logged-in users (e.g., syllbus upload and credit system). <br>
<ins>Technical Considerations:</ins> Decided to use Firebase for authentication to streamline development. <br>
<ins>Risk:</ins> Limited time may impact the depth of testing; focus on ensuring core functionality works before adding enhancements. <br>

**6. Action Items** <br>
<ins>Design Team:</ins> Complete UI designs for registration, upload, credit system, and search by the first half of the sprint. <br>
<ins>Development Team:</ins> Begin backend work for user authentication and credit tracking, then move to front-end integration. <br>

**7. Spikes** <br>
<ins>Technical Spikes:</ins> Various members are new to JavaScript and REACT. Front-end in general is a new concept to some members. There will be limitations within the sprint of what was manageable and accomplished given the knowledge base. As the sprints continue, it is expected that individual skillsets will develop so that complex features can be implemented. <br>

**8. Conclusion** <br>
Sprint 1 will deliver core platform functionalities, allowing users to create accounts, upload syllabi, and earn/view credits. This establishes a foundation for future engagement and feature expansion in upcoming sprints.
