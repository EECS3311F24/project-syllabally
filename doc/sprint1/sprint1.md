**Sprint 1 Planning Meeting (sprint1.md)**
**Project Title:** Syllabally

**1.  Sprint Goal**
The goal of sprint 1 is to establish the core functionalities of the platform, enabling students to create accounts, search for courses, and the credits system. By the end of the sprint, the platform should allow users to register, authenticate, and interact with basic content features, building the foundation for the platform.

**2. Participants**
Product Owner: Maya Shamir
Developers: Thomas Aziz
UI/UX Designers: Hien Le

**3. Sprint 1 User Stories**

User Story 1: User Registration and Authentication
As a student, I want to create an account so that I can access the platform and share syllabi.
User Story 2: Contribution Credit System
As a student, I want to view my contribution credit balance, so I can keep track of how much I can unlock.
User Story 3: Basic Search Functionality
As a student, I want to search through syllabi so that I can find relevant resources efficiently.

**4. Task Breakddown**

**6. Decisions and Notes**

Priority User Stories: User registration and authentication, as well as search for courses, are the highest priority to allow user engagement with the platform from the beginning.
Dependencies: User registration must be completed before any features requiring logged-in users (e.g., syllbus upload and credit system).
Technical Considerations: Decided to use Firebase for authentication to streamline development.
Risk: Limited time may impact the depth of testing; focus on ensuring core functionality works before adding enhancements.

**7. Action Items**

Design Team: Complete UI designs for registration, upload, credit system, and search by the first half of the sprint.
Development Team: Begin backend work for user authentication and credit tracking, then move to front-end integration.

**8. Conclusion**
Sprint 1 will deliver core platform functionalities, allowing users to create accounts, upload syllabi, and earn/view credits. This establishes a foundation for future engagement and feature expansion in upcoming sprints.
